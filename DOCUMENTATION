HoNCore - A Python library providing a framework for communicating with the HoN chat and master servers.


Client settings/configuration
------------------------------------

The client provides a method which allows modification of it's settings. The default settings should prove to be good enough, but optionally things like logging in as invisible or updating the chat protocol version may be desirable.
The settings available and their default values are :
	
	Name 			Default 								Desc
	chatport 		11031									The port used for the chat server connection. 
	chatver 		0x0E									The chat protocol version sent when authenticating.
	invis 			False									A flag used to toggle invisible mode when logging in.
	masterserver 	http://masterserver.hon.s2games.com/	The master server used for HTTP requests.
	basicserver 	http://heroesofnewerth.com/				The basic server used for some HTTP requests.
	honver			2.0.39.1 								The version of HoN, used when setting the user agent.

The server addresses MUST contain the forward slash at the end.

To configure the client pass the desired keyword arguments to the client.configure() method like so:
client.configure(chatver=15, invis=True)

Exceptions
------------------------------------

Three exceptions can be caught
	* HoNException
	* MasterServerError
	* ChatServerError
	* HoNConfigError - To be considered.

All exceptions raised will provide an error code and an error message, available through the attributes 'code' and 'error'.

HoNException is the base exception class.

MasterServerError will be raised when communicating with the master server, this includes any tasks which use the requester module to send HTTP GET/POST requests such as logging in/out or requesting the message of the day list.

ChatServerError will be raised when communicating with the chat server, this includes any task which involves working with sockets or sending/receiving packets.

The error code id's are assigned as the following.

000 -> 100 : Not yet assigned
100 -> 200 : MasterServerError
200 -> 300 : ChatServerError

The available error codes at the current time are as follows.


100 : 'Could not connect to the masterserver.'
101 : 'Could not obtain login data.'
102 : 'Incorrect username/password.'
