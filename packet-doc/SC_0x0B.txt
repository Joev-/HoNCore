Packet ID : 0x0B	Name: Initial Status
---------------------------------------------------------

This packet contains a huge amount of data which contains statuses for buddies, clan members and channel members. Aswell as some sort of matchmaking settings and a global player count. It's basically the status updates for everything all at once.

Clan members are grouped with buddies. In a scenario where there are 4 buddies online and one other clan member the buddy count would show 6. This is 4 buddies and 2 clan members, including one's self.

The following blocks of data are contained in this packet:
	* Packet Size & Identification
	* Buddy and Clan member information

Notes 
-----

1. - The name isn't very specific, but this is the total number of buddies AND clan members online.
2. - The following data appears twice, unsure why or what it represents.
3. - No idea what this is, it varies slightly for each user logged in. Represents a small integer like 3114.
4. - I don't think these are static, if no one is in a channel and one joins that channel then it is 'created' and thus assigned a new ID.
5. - Unsure of what this represents.
6. - This is always the same (89) and in the same location, before the channel topic and after the unknown integer. Unsure of what it represents.
7. - Find out what the possible values are.
8. - Not entirely sure it is a string, could be a 32 bit integer and a 16 bit integer. Unsure what it represents anyway.
9. - Again, another large string of unknown data, unsure if it is a string. Probably not. The size seems to vary depending on how many people are in a chat channel? Not sure..
